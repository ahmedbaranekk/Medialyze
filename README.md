## 🔧 **Installation Guide**  
Follow these simple steps to set up the project locally:  

1. **Download the Project**  
   - Download the complete repository from [here](#).  
   - Extract the files to your desired location on your device.  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.  
   - Navigate to the project folder and install the required libraries by running:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```  

3. **Optional: Create a Virtual Environment**  
   - To keep your setup clean, create a virtual environment:  
     ```bash
     python -m venv env  
     source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux  
     env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows  
     ```  

4. **Run the Application**  
   - Copy the file path of `main.py` from your device.  
   - In the terminal or command prompt, run:  
     ```bash
     streamlit run [path_to_main.py]
     ```  
   - Replace `[path_to_main.py]` with the actual file path you copied.  
   - Access the app via the local hosting link provided in the terminal.
